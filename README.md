# Longest Common Subsequence
This program is a Java implementation of the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm. It takes two strings as input and finds the longest common subsequence between them.

## How to use
1. Compile and run the Main class
2. Enter the first string when prompted
3. Enter the second string when prompted
4. The program will output the length of the LCS and the LCS itself

## Features
- The program uses dynamic programming approach to solve the LCS problem efficiently.
- The LCS is case sensitive
- The program also handles empty input and whitespace

## Note
- The program uses recursion to print out the LCS
- The program uses two 2D arrays C and D to keep track of the LCS and the direction of the LCS.
